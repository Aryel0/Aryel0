Hey, I’m Ariel.

I’m an AI & Big Data master’s student at Aivancity, currently based in Paris, and I have interest in AI/ML but also in game development and low code software engineering 

What I work on right now:

  -Strengthening my skills in AI engineering and data processing.

  -Building projects ranging from RAG-powered agents to simple video games.

  -Experimenting with image generation, a low code languague. 

  -Exploring how automation and intelligent systems can simplify workflows and solve real problems.

Beyond the code:
When I disconnect from Python, I’m usually training, playing games, exploring tech, or building personal projects because I just love experiments 

Let’s connect:
I’m always open to discussing AI, backend architecture, automation, or just playing some games.
